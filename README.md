# Churn-Modelling-ANN-Model
This is the dataset used in the section "ANN (Artificial Neural Networks)" of the Udemy course from Kirill Eremenko (Data Scientist & Forex Systems Expert) and Hadelin de Ponteves (Data Scientist), called Deep Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Artificial Neural Networks. The dataset is very useful for beginners of Machine Learning, and a simple playground where to compare several techniques/skills.

The story: A bank is investigating a very high rate of customer leaving the bank. Here is a 10,000 records dataset to investigate and predict which of the customers are more likely to leave the bank soon.

The story of the story: I'd like to try something on Kaggle to improve my basic knowledge on Deep Learning.
