# Churn-Modelling-ANN-Model
This is the dataset used in the section "ANN (Artificial Neural Networks)" of the Udemy course from Kirill Eremenko (Data Scientist & Forex Systems Expert) and Hadelin de Ponteves (Data Scientist), called Deep Learning A-Zâ„¢: Hands-On Artificial Neural Networks. The dataset is very useful for beginners of Machine Learning, and a simple playground where to compare several techniques/skills.
